# Netflix_stock_price_prediction
Stock Price Prediction Project using Linear Regression, SVM, and KNN for forecasting Netflix stock prices based on historical data

This project focuses on predicting Netflix (NFLX) stock prices using machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVM), and K-nearest neighbours (KNN). The models are trained on historical stock market data from the "NFLX.csv" dataset to forecast future stock prices.

Stock Price Prediction Project using machine learning models like Linear Regression, SVM, and KNN to forecast Netflix (NFLX) stock prices based on historical data from the 'NFLX.csv' dataset. Evaluate and compare model performance with metrics such as MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R2-scores.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is named "NFLX.csv." It contains the following columns:
- `Date`: The date of the data point.
- `Open`: The opening price of Netflix stock on that date.
- `High`: The highest price of Netflix stock during the day.
- `Low`: The lowest price of Netflix stock during the day.
- `Close`: The closing price of Netflix stock on that date.
- `Adj Close`: The adjusted closing price, considering events like stock splits and dividends.
- `Volume`: The trading volume, representing the number of shares traded on that date.

## Usage

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Install the required Python libraries.
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the machine-learning models.

## Models and Evaluation

The project uses Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVM), and K-nearest neighbours (KNN) to predict stock prices. It evaluates model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R2) score.
